## Projects

* [New York City Taxi Trip Duration](nyctaxi.md)

   The goal is building a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. The dataset includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables. This project was part of a competition hosted in Kaggle.

* [Box-Plots for Education](boxplots.md)

   This project features a multi-class-multi-label classification problem. The goal is attaching canonical labels to the freeform text in school budget items, which helps to compare budget or expenditure data across districts. This project was part of a competition hosted in DrivenData.

* [Government Spending Contracts](gov.md)

   The Government Spending Contracts dataset includes over 15 years of contracts, from 2000-2016, with the federal government. In this project I explore the agencies that award the most contracts, the industries that receive the most contracts, the percentage of contracts per state over the years and seasonality of the contracts awarded.
