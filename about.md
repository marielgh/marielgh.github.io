Hello there!

My name is Mariel. I am a biophysics master's graduate and during the last three years I have collaborated with different groups at universities and research institutes, applying computational tools to different fields. 

I have completed several courses on the subjects of data science and machine learning and now I am working independently on data science projects (some of them in Kaggle and DrivenData) and learning a lot on the way.
