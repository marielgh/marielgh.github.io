Hello there!

My name is Mariel. I am a master's graduate in biophysics and during the last three years I have collaborated with different groups at universities and research institutes, applying computational tools to different fields. 

I am a scientist at heart, really curious about almost everything that surrounds me, from the most fundamental science to the latest technology. That's why I studied physics for my bachelor's degree, at University of Barcelona. After that, I looked for new challenges abroad and I moved on to do a master's degree in biophysics in Munich, Germany. During the last year of my master's, I became increasingly interested in data science and machine learning. I find really exciting the potential of data to generate knowledge and how machine learning helps us make predictions and find meaning in data.

I have completed several courses on the subjects of data science and machine learning and now I am working independently on data science projects and learning a lot on the way. I am open to professional opportunities in New York City and surroundings.
