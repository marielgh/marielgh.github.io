## About me

Hello there!

My name is Mariel. I am a biophysics master's graduate and during the last three years I have collaborated with different groups at universities and research institutes, applying computational tools to different fields. 

I am a scientist at heart, really curious about almost everything that surrounds me, from the most fundamental stuff to the latest technology. That's why I studied physics for my Bachelor's degree, at University of Barcelona. After that, I looked for new challenges abroad and I moved on to study a Master's degree in Munich, Germany. I find really exciting the potential of data to generate knowledge and how machine learning helps us make predictions and find meaning in the data.

I have completed several courses on the subjects of data science and machine learning and now I am working independently on data science projects and learning a lot on the way.
