Hello there! I'm Mariel. I am a master's graduate in biophysics and during the last three years I have collaborated with different groups at universities and research institutes, applying computational tools to different fields. 

I am a scientist at heart, really curious about almost everything that surrounds me, from the most fundamental science to the latest technology. That's why I studied physics for my bachelor's degree, at University of Barcelona. After that, I looked for new challenges abroad and I moved on to do a master's degree in biophysics in Munich, Germany. During my master's, I became increasingly interested in data science and machine learning. I find really exciting the potential of data to generate knowledge and how machine learning helps us make predictions and find meaning in data.

Apart from the geeky stuff, I enjoy a lot travelling and getting to know new places, cultures and languages! My brain speaks a mixture of spanish, english, catalan, german, french and python.
