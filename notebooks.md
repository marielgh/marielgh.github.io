* [Pandas](pandas.html#bottom)
   
   Pandas is the most widely used package in Python to manage datasets. Here I show some of its basic functionality (managing time series data, different plotting methods, etc.) with various examples. 

* [Cleaning Data in Python](cleaning_data.html#bottom)

   A vital component of data science involves acquiring raw data and getting it into a form ready for analysis. In this notebook, I show some of the tools available in Python to clean data, which involves dealing with outliers, missing values or duplicates, pivoting and melting, formatting using regular expressions, etc.
   
* [Financial Data in Python](financial.html#bottom)

   In this notebook I import financial data from Google Finance and the Federal Reserve Economic Data using pandas Datareader and explore stock trends, the most important companies per sector, compare stock exchanges and more. Plots are produced using the matplotlib and seaborn packages.
   
* [Supervised Learning (with scikit-learn)](supervised_learning.html#bottom)

   Scikit-learn is one of the most popular libraries for machine learning in Python. In this notebook I show various examples of supervised learning with scikit-learn, including building pipelines and hyperparameter tuning.
   
* [Unsupervised Learning in Python](unsupervised_learning.html#bottom)

   In this notebook I show some of the standard unsupervised learning algorithms in scikit-learn and scipy such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, t-SNE, principal component analysis , singular value decomposition and non-negative matrix factorization.
   
* [SQL](SQL.md)

   Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard language for relational database management systems. In this notebook I review different types of queries using filtering, aggregate functions, sorting, grouping and joins and more advanced topics such as set operations and subqueries.
