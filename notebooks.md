## Notebooks

1. ### Pandas [[see notebook](pandas.html#bottom)]
   
   Pandas is the most widely used package in Python to manage datasets. Here I show some of its basic functionality (managing time series data, different plotting methods, etc) with various examples. 
   
2. ### Financial Data in Python [[see notebook](financial.html#bottom)]

   In this notebook I import financial data from Google Finance and the Federal Reserve Economic Data using pandas Datareader and explore stock trends, the most important companies per sector, compare stock exchanges and more. Plots are produced using the matplotlib and seaborn packages.
   
3. ### Supervised Learning (with scikit-learn) [[see notebook](supervised_learning.html#bottom)]

   Scikit-learn is one of the most popular libraries for machine learning in Python. In this notebook I show various examples of supervised learning with scikit-learn, including building pipelines and hyperparameter tuning.
   
4. ### Unsupervised Learning in Python

   In this notebook I show some of the standard unsupervised learning algorithms in scikit-learn and scipy such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, t-SNE, principal component analysis , singular value decomposition and non-negative matrix factorization.
